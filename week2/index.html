      <h1>Fun Facts About Leopards</h1>
      <p> Most leopards live in sub-Saharan Africa, northeast Africa, Central Asia, India, and China. Sadly, much of their population is endangered. Leopards are in the same family as lions, ligers, and jaguars. Leopards have many different skills to survive in their aggressive environment. For one, they often kill their prey in tree branches, where they are most comfortable. They also blend in with the leaves here, which allows them to be invisible before pouncing. Aditionally, leopards are strong swimmers and can eat fish or crabs. The patterns on leopards are called rosettes because they look similar to the shape of a rose. Black panthers are actually leopards who are almost completely black, as their spots blend in with their black fur.
