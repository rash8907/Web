    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
      I grew up in the Bay Area, about an hour south from San Francisco. I have one older sister, a younger brother, 
      two amazing parents, and two dogs. 
    </p>
      <p> I enjoy swimming, traveling, reading, hiking, skiing, and hanging out with 
      my friends in my free time. I am super happy classes are back in person and life 
      is slowly going back to normal now.

    </p>
