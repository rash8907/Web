    <h3>Facts About Me</h3>
    <p>
      I grew up in the Bay Area, about an hour south from San Francisco. I have one older sister, a younger brother, two amazing parents, and two dogs. I enjoy swimming, traveling, reading, hiking, skiing, and hanging out with my friends in my free time. I am super happy classes are back in person and life is slowly going back to normal now.
