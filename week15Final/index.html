<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I am currenlty a junior at University of Colorado at Boulder pursuing a degree in Computer Science and Grpahic Design. I am orginally from the Bay Area in California and lived there my whole life. I am currenlty apart of the swim club and Bollywood dance team at Boulder. In my free time I love to workout, cook, read, ski, and watch the sunrises and sunsets. I am the middle child of three kids and we have two of the cutest dogs! As a family, we love to go on hikes together and cook plant based meals.</p>
